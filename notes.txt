== BEFORE you run ANT DISTRIB ==

 Make sure you put the right install.rdf in the build-packages. You can also use signed install.rdf file if you want to deploy your extension with a nice update mechanism. If you are doing this, get your key signed ( with McCoy ). In this project case I am keeping the keys in the ./deployment-keys directory, so make sure you copied the file from ./deployment-keys  .. to the ./build-packages

== TODO ==

 * PersonalTooolbar work in browser/browser.css. The icons for the highlight mode. 
 * Fix the toolbar-background.svg and bookmark-toolbar-background to be simple
 * modify browser.css bookmark-toolbar-background-inactive.gif _ _ _ to - - - and make inactive in the src browser .svg

== Check ==

 * personal toolbar font size is set to 82% in the browser.css check for 82 keyword in the doc. This is so that the font does not move the background. This is MacOSX works fine

== To Modify Colors ==

vi src/theme/svg/biblioteca/base.css
