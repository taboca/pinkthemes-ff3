perltooc - Tom's OO Tutorial for Class Data in Perl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

When designing an object class, you are sometimes faced with the situation
of wanting common state shared by all objects of that class.
Such I<class attributes> act somewhat like global variables for the entire
class, but unlike program-wide globals, class attributes have meaning only to
the class itself.

Here are a few examples where class attributes might come in handy:

=item *

to keep a count of the objects you've created, or how many are
still extant.

=item *

to extract the name or file descriptor for a logfile used by a debugging
method.

=item *

to access collective data, like the total amount of cash dispensed by
all ATMs in a network in a given day.

=item *

to access the last object created by a class, or the most accessed object,
or to retrieve a list of all objects.
